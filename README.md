<ul>
<li> The most fundamental human needs of water are for drinking, cooking, bathing  and personal hygiene. To meet these needs, the quality of the water used must fix no risk to human health.Water quality testing and monitoring is important for our environment. Water quality parameters such as pH, turbidity, conductivity and phosphate levels are important measures that can affect the quality of water in our environment.

</picture> Problem Statement :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li>Due to the fast growing urbanization supply of safe
drinking water is a challenge for the every city authority.
Water can be polluted any time. So the water we reserved
in the water tank at our roof top or basement in our
society or apartment may not be safe. Still in India most of
the people use simple water purifier that is not enough to
get surety of pure water. Sometimes the water has
dangerous particles or chemical mixed and general
purpose water purifier cannot purify that. And it’s
impossible to check the quality of water manually in every
time. So an automatic real-time monitoring system is
required to monitor the health of the water reserved in
our water tank of the society or apartment. So it can warn
us automatically if there is any problem with the reserved
water. And we can check the quality of the water anytime
and from anywhere.

</picture> Problem Solution :</h2></div>
<ul>
<li> Main goal is to develop quality water for drinking.
pH, Turbidity and Temperature sensors are
used to gather the parameters necessary to monitor water
health in real time
<li>Buy a home testing kit and dip each testing strip into a glass of tap water. Use the chart that came with the kit to determine your water quality.
<li>Go to your city’s website to find your local area’s Water Quality Report.
<li>Send alert messages when any discrepancies are found
in the water quality.
 </ul>
